# **üîê Gossips \- A Privacy-Focused Messenger**

Gossips is a privacy-first Android messaging application built with Kotlin and Firebase. It's designed for users who demand absolute confidentiality in their conversations. The app features a unique **Secure Mode**, which enables robust, end-to-end AES encryption where the users themselves control the encryption key.

## **‚ú® Core Features**

* **User-Controlled E2E Encryption**: In Secure Mode, all messages are encrypted and decrypted locally on the device using AES. The encryption key is generated by the users and shared privately, ensuring only the participants can read the messages.  
* **Ephemeral Chat History**: To guarantee privacy, the entire chat history of a Secure Mode session is **automatically and permanently erased** the moment the session is interrupted (e.g., app closed, user logs out).  
* **Firebase Backend**: Utilizes Firebase for reliable real-time message delivery and user authentication, without storing any unencrypted message content.  
* **Modern Android Development**: Built with 100% Kotlin, following modern Android architecture patterns.  
* **Minimalist UI**: A clean and intuitive user interface that focuses on the conversation.

## **üõ°Ô∏è The Security Model**

Transparency is key for a security-focused application. Here‚Äôs how Gossips protects your privacy:

1. **Key Generation**: To start a Secure Mode chat, one user generates a secret key (a strong string of text).  
2. **Secure Key Exchange**: This key must be shared with the other participant via a secure, out-of-band channel (e.g., in person, or using another trusted communication method). Gossips **never** transmits this key.  
3. **Local Encryption**: Before any message is sent to the Firebase backend, it is encrypted on the user's device using the shared AES key. The data sent over the network is always ciphertext.  
4. **Local Decryption**: When a message is received, it is decrypted locally on the recipient's device using the same shared key.  
5. **Automatic Deletion**: The moment the chat activity is closed or the app loses focus, the entire conversation log for that session is wiped from the local device, leaving no trace.

## **üöÄ Getting Started**

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Gossips.git

2. **Setup Firebase:**  
   * Create a new project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).  
   * Add an Android app to your Firebase project with the package name from the app's build.gradle file.  
   * Download the google-services.json file and place it in the app/ directory of the project.  
   * Enable **Firestore** and **Authentication** (e.g., Email/Password) in the Firebase console.  
3. **Open in Android Studio:**  
   * Open the project in Android Studio.  
   * Let Gradle sync and build the project.  
   * Run the app on an emulator or a physical device.
